# Out of Office

Published 12-18-2022

I got everything running on the Chromebook so that I could on it instead. I love the macbook but it gets a little cramped trying to work on there for a long period.  
I am typing this as Taiylor does her nails. She has no idea what I'm working on. She's applying her top coat, and I am brainstorming on how to layout the site. Lyamm is playing fortnite and got 17 KOs. This is a good night.  
I didn't get to work on the site as much as I wanted to, but we had a busy weekend. Lyamm and I went to see the new Avatar yesterday afternoon, and then we went night riding with friends.  
Christmas is next weekend, and I will be putting in work to make sure this is ready by then!
