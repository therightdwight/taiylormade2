# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2022-12-12

Welcome to my _new blog_ about this website I am creating. I wanted to create something special to celebrate my wife and I.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!
   
4. **Making Changes**: As Igo through the tutorial I will make the necessary changes to alter the site to what I am envisioning. 

## What's next

I will continually add posts as I build this site to chronicle this little project.
